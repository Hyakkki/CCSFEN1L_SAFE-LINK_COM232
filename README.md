# SafeLink

**SafeLink** is an automated link validation and security scanning system designed to protect users from malicious or suspicious URLs. This project emphasizes the importance of **cybersecurity and digital forensics** in everyday browsing by creating a lightweight and user-friendly tool accessible to students, educators, and local communities.

## Project Overview

Unlike existing solutions that are either complex or limited to browser/email filters, SafeLink offers a simple and preventive approach to link verification. It automatically scans and validates URLs whether direct or shortened before users open them, reducing risks of phishing, malware, and scams.

The system aims to balance **usability** and **security**, making cybersecurity accessible to non-technical users. By metadata checks and URL pattern analysis, SafeLink delivers **real-time scanning** and **instant feedback** for safer online experiences.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Main IDE for coding and integration
* **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration
* **Figma**: For user interface design and prototyping
* **Database**

## Key Features

* **Automated URL Scanning**: Detects phishing, malware, and suspicious redirects.
* **QR Code Support**: Allows scanning of QR codes that redirect to URLs.
* **Threat Detection**: Scans links against databases and heuristic rules.
* **Reports & Alerts**: Provides instant safety scores and recommendations.
* **Metadata Analysis**: Extracts site data (title, SSL, redirects, expiration, registrar details) for deeper checks.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and clarity for non-technical users.
* **Awareness & Education**: Provides safety advice and basic cybersecurity tips.

## Expected Outcomes

This project will deliver a functional **web-based link security scanner** that bridges the gap between professional-grade cybersecurity tools and the needs of everyday users. By focusing on accessibility and practicality, **SafeLink** empowers communities to browse safely, avoid scams, and build stronger cybersecurity awareness.
